# Decorator Pattern in Java

## What is the Decorator Pattern?
The **Decorator Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that allows adding behavior to objects **dynamically** at runtime **without modifying their existing code**. Instead of extending functionality using inheritance, it **relies on composition** by wrapping objects with additional decorators.

This pattern is widely used in scenarios where you need to **extend features dynamically** while keeping the codebase maintainable.

## Advantages of the Decorator Pattern âœ…

âœ” **Dynamically Extends Functionality** â€“ Add or remove features at runtime without modifying existing code.  
âœ” **Avoids Class Explosion** â€“ No need to create multiple subclasses for every possible feature combination.  
âœ” **Follows Open/Closed Principle** â€“ New decorators can be introduced **without modifying** existing components.  
âœ” **Favors Composition Over Inheritance** â€“ Provides a **more flexible** and **scalable** design approach.

## Where is the Decorator Pattern Used? ðŸ“Œ

ðŸ”¹ **Java I/O Streams** â€“ Used in `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, `InputStreamReader`, etc.  
ðŸ”¹ **UI Frameworks** â€“ Adding styles, borders, or themes to UI components dynamically.  
ðŸ”¹ **Logging Frameworks** â€“ Wrapping loggers with additional behaviors such as filtering or formatting.  
ðŸ”¹ **Security Frameworks** â€“ Implementing **authentication layers** or role-based access control (RBAC).  
ðŸ”¹ **Middleware in Web Frameworks** â€“ Adding features like **logging, authentication, and request handling** in frameworks like **Spring Boot, Express.js, and Django**.
